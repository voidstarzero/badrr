# badrr
A bad recursive DNS resolver

## Usage
```
$ ./badrr example.com
```

## Version
v0.5

## Why?
Why not?

I wanted to learn more about how the low-level details of DNS work, so here is my journey.

## Todo
- Process errors (correctly).
- Don't crash when a response contains garbage.
- Check all parameters of the response for consistency.
- Cache things (properly).
